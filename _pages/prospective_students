My work encompasses theoretical analysis, computational methods, and some hardware experiments. Interested students should have some familiarity with control theory or machine learning and programming in Python or MATLAB.

<h2>Graduate Students</h2>
I am looking to hire 1-2 Ph.D. students beginning in Fall 2026. If you believe that my research area may interest you, please look carefully at my pages and learn more about it. You should feel free to download relevant papers of mine.

Generically, I am more likely to be interested if a student is familiar with my work and can explain why they are excited and well-prepared to make contributions in my research group.

If you are interested in working with me, I strongly encourage you to apply to the Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. program at Rice and mention my name in your application. Details about the application process are available [here](https://mech.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/graduate-admissions).
