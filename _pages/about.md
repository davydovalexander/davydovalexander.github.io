Hello! My name is Sasha and I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://mech.rice.edu/) at Rice University. My research is on modern data-driven engineering problems at the intersection of <b>control, machine learning, and optimization</b>. I am broadly interested in robust nonlinear control theory and modern machine learning methods to enable the reliable control of complex engineering systems. I am fascinated by systems where classical control methods fail to provide the desired performance and am excited about developing new control strategies for these systems. I was awarded my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) where I was advised by [Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/). As a Ph.D. student, I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the UCSB Chancellor's Fellowship. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Maryland (UMD). 

As a Ph.D. student, I interned at Toyota Research Institute. While an undergraduate student at UMD, I worked internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT Lincoln Lab, and The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
